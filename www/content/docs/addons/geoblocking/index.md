title: Geoblocking (TODO)
---

Blocking clients from parts of the world via CloudFront geographic restrictions.

This should be possible for free via
[CloudFront geographic restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/georestrictions.html).
Geographic restrictions apply to the entire distribution,
and cannot be set to just certain paths.

This remains untested.
