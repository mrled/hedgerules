Hedgerules handles four types of redirects, all stored in a CloudFront Key Value Store and processed by a viewer-request CloudFront Function.

## Directory index redirects

When your Hugo site has a directory like `docs/`, the S3 object is stored at `docs/index.html`. A request for `/docs` (no trailing slash) needs to redirect to `/docs/`.

Hedgerules generates these automatically by scanning your build output for directories. For every directory, it creates a KVS entry:

```
/docs -> /docs/
```

The CloudFront viewer-request function looks up the request URI in the KVS. If it finds a match, it returns a 301 redirect. If the URI ends with `/`, the function rewrites it to append `index.html` before forwarding to S3.

## Hugo alias redirects

Hugo's `aliases` frontmatter lets you define old URLs that should redirect to the current page:

```yaml
---
title: "Redirects"
aliases:
  - /docs/redirect-guide/
---
```

Hedgerules reads the `_hedge_redirects.txt` file (generated by the Hugo template) and creates KVS entries:

```
/docs/redirect-guide/ -> /docs/redirects/
```

## Custom redirects

You can define arbitrary site-wide redirects in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params.HedgerulesRedirects]
  "/old-page" = "/new-page/"
  "/legacy/path" = "/modern/path/"
```

These are written to `_hedge_redirects.txt` by the Hugo template and read by Hedgerules. They appear first in the redirects file, before Hugo aliases and per-page path redirects.

## Per-page path redirects

The `HedgerulesPathRedirects` frontmatter parameter lets a page define redirects close to the content, rather than in the site-wide config. This is useful for creating redirects to files that don't have frontmatter of their own (images, zip files, etc.).

Each entry has a `from` (the source path) and a `to` (the destination). If `to` starts with `/`, it is used as an absolute path. Otherwise, it is treated as relative and prefixed with the page's `RelPermalink`.

```yaml
---
title: "Formulae"
HedgerulesPathRedirects:
  - from: /formulae
    to: interesting-formula.pdf
  - from: /other-page
    to: /docs/somewhere-else/
---
```

If the page lives at `/docs/formulae/`, this generates:

```
/formulae -> /docs/formulae/interesting-formula.pdf
/other-page -> /docs/somewhere-else/
```

## KVS constraints

CloudFront KVS has size limits:
- Maximum key size: 512 bytes
- Maximum key + value size: 1 KB (1024 bytes)
- Maximum total data size: 5 MB

Hedgerules validates these constraints before uploading and reports errors if any entry exceeds them.
