I'm designing a CLI tool that works with Hugo. Look at the README and the examples to see how it's supposed to work. The examples include CloudFormation and two sites - that is expected to be abnormal, the docs we publish should just show how to do a single site. The example command line tools are implemented in Python, but we want to build the same logic (minus any bugs!) in Go. Create an agent team to explore this: one team mate to design the architecture, one teammate focused on the Go implementation, one teammate who builds an example Hugo site including documetnation and test paths, one teammate who is concerned with making things simpler for the USER (less configuration, one-step deploys, handle errors, etc), and one teammate who is concerned with making our code as simple as possible (do less, let perverse cases fail, delete code, delete features). Theese last two teammates will produce conflicting advice, and it is your job as agent lead to decide on the best path. This is an open source project and is not monetizable, so account for this in your decision making.
